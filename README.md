## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a portfolio page to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position. Currently, this page is unfinished because the class I'm taking has only just started. I have one project of my own deplyed at this time, so I included it and other placeholder images for now. As class continues, I will exchange the placeholders for real applications with some of my strongest work. The portfolio page I created includes a short about me bio section, a section showcasing images of my work with working links, a contact me section with ways to get in touch with me and look at more of my work, and a resume section that will be added to once I have learned more in class. I have learned that creating a page with a responive layout is important because it makes the page more accessible and easier to navigate.
